<h3> Annabelle</h3>
<p> Her jet black hair, is long, straight and well looked after. Her eyes were incredibly bright blue and had a white sparkle about them. Her porcelain skin wasn't as smooth as someone may expect. She had chubby cheeks, a small stub like nose and slightly torn lips. She had a scar running from the corner of her lip half way across her teeth. Her breasts were almost non existent. They were minuscule at best. The rest of her body was thin, petite. Her body was split perfectly but her body had the appearance of seeming very long.

<h3>Henry</h3>
<p>His strong presence not only came from his personality but also his large body. He was a league taller than most other men, standing tall at six foot three, his long light brown hair was long enough to reach his neck and cover it, he usually kept it combed back, its thickness kept it from falling forward down his face if he were to look down at all. His body wasn't too slender and he had incredibly defined muscles, his chest and legs were probably his best features, their insane definition was a sight to be seen. he also had a small, thick beard, the hair curled under his chin and jawbone incredibly neatly. His eyes were a light mud brown however they were not very noticeable as his beard and body drew attention away from everything else.</p>
